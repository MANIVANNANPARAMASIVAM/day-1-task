Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1

The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.
Because it went through several stages of development this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
This version is still in use on the web.
The first response that a client receives on an HTTP GET request is often not the fully rendered page. 
HTTP/1.1 takes care of this problem by introducing persistent connections and pipelining. With persistent connections, HTTP/1.1 assumes that a TCP connection should be kept open unless directly told to close.
This allows the client to send multiple requests along the same connection without waiting for a response to each, greatly improving the performance of HTTP/1.1 over HTTP/1.0.

HTTP2

In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate.
In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
This protocol served as a template for HTTP/2 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group httpbis of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) put the standard together, culminating in the publication of HTTP/2 in May 2015.
From the beginning, many browsers supported this standardization effort, including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari.
Due in part to this browser support, there has been a significant adoption rate of the protocol since 2015, with especially high rates among new sites.
